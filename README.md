Minimal HTTP server, supporting

    - SSL sockets/certs
    - keep-alive/persistent http
    - compression
    - cookies/session management
    - cache control - with etags /http if-none-found/ 304
    - url rewriting
    - streaming io (using file/stringio - still need chunked transfer) .
    - filter chains
    - static assets from file-system
    - redirect to https
    - mime mappping
    - simple example of event sourcing model 

TODO,
    - improve logging, especially ip
    - chunked transfer
    - websockets
    - cache cotnrol example using last modified
    - public cache example would be interesting
