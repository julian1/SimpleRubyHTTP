- need to get real-time update. by polling or something.
	- very basic - need to test whether new data, before
	doing larger query or updating.

- IMPORTANT compress data, when sending.

- IMPORTANT cache control over resources jquery and jflot etc.



	http://www.jqplot.com/  looks nice as well as flot.
		supports multiple y axis also - http://www.jqplot.com/tests/zooming.php

- think we should route the message cracking down into the controller / model class.
- means there's just a single point to handle.
	- then we don't have to separate out the routing...


	- event_processor( model)
	- controller( model)
	- router( controller) 

- we need dates. 


- in place of web-sockets - it would be very easy to poll, requesting
whether there was any more data in the last 10 secs.  and then doing
an update.

done ok - , we want to pull out the key parsing from webserver.

done and change the name.

then create a web_root dir to some html 

done - change name keys to message or similar

change the serve file - so it takes the request - and not all the
	rest of the keys.

ok. now we actually want to serve model data.
----

it's very close to being real time.

ok, it would be nice to have real-time display of date
